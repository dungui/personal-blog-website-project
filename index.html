            <p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, and has since spread globally, resulting in the ongoing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic" target="blank"> 2019â€“20 coronavirus pandemic.</a></p>

                Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection with coronavirus include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water often and for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus as explained in detail below.

                        Social distancing is an effective protective measure against the new coronavirus, says the World Health Organization.
                        It recommends people keep at least 1 metre apart.
                        Around the world, measures to ensure people observe this are in force ...

                        There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.

                        Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts. <br> vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health.
